<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    I grew up in the small village of L√∂t on the island of √ñland, where most of my close family
    still lives. During high school, I moved to Kalmar to study Technology with a focus on IT at
    John Bauer High School.

<p>
    It was there that I was first introduced to programming through C++ and Java, as well as basic
    web development with HTML, CSS, and PHP. I quickly became fascinated by development, which led
    me to continue my studies at Blekinge Institute of Technology, where I pursued Web Programming.

<p>
    Since then, I have continuously grown in my roles and am driven by learning new things. With
    experience as an SEO technician, web support specialist, project manager, frontend developer,
    and full-stack developer, I have gained a broad understanding of the entire development process.
    I am passionate about transforming customer needs into smart, user-friendly solutions that make
    their everyday lives easier.

<p>
    When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring digital worlds in RPG and MMORPG games, as well as
    reading up on new technologies. Since 2024, I have also taken up a new interest in cycling and
    exploring the real world as well! Slowly but surely forward - üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
